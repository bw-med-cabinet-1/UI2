            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission at Med Cabinet is to assist new users, age 45 and up, who are trying to get off pharmaceuticals, under Medical Professional recommendations, and want to use cannabis as a means to battle medical conditions and ailments. By providing our users with the ability to search for strains by ailment or symptoms, find a local dispensary, recommended dosage, intake method, create dosing schedule, and keep a list of all recommended strains and dispensaries we hope to promote effective usage of cannabis.</p>
